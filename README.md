  Selenium Tests

  This repository is a testament to my journey of self-learning, where I have applied the Selenium framework in conjunction with xUnit to perform a series of tests on the OLX website. 
   
  It serves as a practical demonstration of my acquired skills and understanding of the fundamentals of the automated testing.

## Insights into the Code Structure
### Page Object Model
The tests incorporated the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern, a highly recommended approach for website testing. This design pattern improves test maintenance and code management.
### Page Component Object Model
The OLX website presented repeating web elements across various pages. To handle this efficiently and prevent code redundancy, the **Page Component Object Model (PCOM)** was implemented. This crucial feature allowed to prevent code duplication and improved reusability.
### Extensions
To further enhance the efficiency of the tests, extensions for web elements were used. These extensions encapsulated recurring method calls during testing, promoting cleaner and more readable code.
